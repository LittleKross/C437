### CAN-SPAM

CAN-SPAM act stands for Controlling the Assault of Non-solicited Pornography and Marketing act of 2003. This requires companies to meet a certain standard so as to avoid consumers being constantly bombarded with unwanted emails. This requires them to meet many rules, such as providing a clear unsubscribe button as well as clearly marking emails as advertising.

This act significantly affects technology and particularly automation. If the company has any automated emails, these emails must be stringently regulated in a manner that ensures compliance with this act. This requires both foresight and effort on the part of the dev and IT teams as well as legal departments to review email headers, links to unsubscribe pages, and the nature of the email's intent.

### FERPA

FERPA stands for the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. This requires educational institutions that recieve direct funding from the government to ensure that all student records are secure and only accessible by that student.

This has a significant impact on the required security for educational institutions. As these records must be locked in some form of encryption as well as regularly checked for vulnerabilities. The data health must be monitored as well to ensure that this data is accurate and has not been corrupted.

### US Patriot Act

USA Patriot Act stands for the United and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001. This act allow for the government to monitor individuals suspected of terrorism without their consent or a need for a warrant. This allows for them to look through phone records, search history, as well as detain anyone for an indefinite amount of time no matter the circumstances.

This poses a privacy concern for anyone living in the United States. Because these laws are so sweeping, they can be abused without any accountability. And in addition, because they can detain any one for an indefinite amount of time this can cause serious security concerns for everyone.

### SOC

SOC stands for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This act made many requirements of publicly traded companies to avoid accounting fraud. This act required the CEO and CFO to sign off on finanical statements, as well as creating standards for the auditing industry.

This removed a level of privacy from companies that they were able to work the system to get. This act helped ensure that there was no security concerns because of misinformation or other falsified records. The affects to the auditing ecosystem also helped create accountability so that corporations are not able to play the system to look better or make competitors look worse.
