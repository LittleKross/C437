### Mutillidae Hacking

In this project I intend to show some of the more in-depth ways of hacking Mutillidae on a higher security level than was previously done in the homework. I am looking to specifically target injections and gaining access to the file structure. I intend to look at the differences that come with the higher security and explain why the more secure version of the app is harder to inject into or manipulate.
